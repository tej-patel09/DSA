## Introduction

This repository showcases my understanding and implementation skills in data structures and algorithms using Python and PHP. The code is organized by language, with each directory containing implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Python Implementations

The Python directory includes implementations of the following data structures and algorithms:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Graph
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

## PHP Implementations

The PHP directory includes similar implementations as in Python. Currently working on it.

## Topics Covered

The implementations cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Graph
- Sorting Algorithms

## Certificate
